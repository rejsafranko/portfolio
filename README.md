# Software Engineer
 
## Work Experience
**Software Engineer @ CodX Solutions (_July 2023 - Present_)**
- Developed and deployed a web application with Next.js, Node.js and AWS for structured medical report generation from voice input.
- Developed and deployed a web application with Next.js, Flask and Azure Container Apps for assisting medical imaging diagnosis. I fine-tuned and deployed PyTorch ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 models for classifying diseases from medical images.
- Developed a serverless MLOps system with dockerized Python Lambda functions and SQL for a medical service suggestion model on AWS.
   
**Natural Language Processing Engineer @ TakeLab (_July 2022 - October 2022_)**
- Fine-tuned Huggingface RoBERTa and DistilBERT models on DocEE for event extraction in the AIDWAS (Artificial Intelligence Disaster Warning System) project.
- Preprocessed the DocEE dataset for argument extraction with BIO tagging sequence labeling method.

## Education								       		
- M.S., Data Science	| Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Zagreb (_July 2024_)	 			        		
- B.S., Computing | Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Zagreb (_September 2022_)

## Achievements
- Developed a [machine learning solution](https://gitlab.com/overfittingoverlords/lumen-hotel-occupancy-prediction) which got 2nd place in the LUMEN Data Science competition. The task was to create and deploy time-series models for predicting hotel room occupancy for a given reservation.

## Projects
### [Movie Recommendation Sytem]

Developed a movie recommendation model based on custom collaborative filtering. Create an MLOps system for model deployment with a Flask server, Apache Airflow orchestration, MLflow model management, PostgreSQL database and MinIO model storage.

### [Fish Cultivation Classifier]

An academic effort which focuses on development of a fish cultivation classifier on a dataset owned by the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries of Croatia. I display the use of computer vision techniques, including data augmentation, a Huggingface Vision Transformer (ViT), and a Tensorflow ResNet50 architecture for achieving accurate and robust classification results. Additionally, I've implemented a Grad-CAM visualizer for AI explainability, providing insights into the model's decision-making process.

### [Song Lyric Generation with Deep Models]

A research project which aims to create song lyric generators using various deep learning models with PyTorch and Tensorflow. I've implemented four generators in total. Two for generic lyric generation and two for specific artist lyric generation. The models were trained on a song lyric datset created from 2 different data sources and evaluated through human assessments to ensure the generated lyrics are meaningful and stylistically accurate.

### [NBA Shot Predictor]

Developed a model which classifies wheter a shot attempt was a score or a miss. Created an MLOps system for model deployment which consists of a Flask server, a PostgreSQL database and an Apache Airflow workflow orchestration for model retraining.
