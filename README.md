## Professional Projects

### Speech To Text Medical Assistant

A web application built with Next.js, Node.js and AWS for helping medical professionals create reports by voice input. It uses OpenAI’s GPT 3.5 to generate a structured medical report from a voice transcription generated by Google CloudSpeech. The app is deployed on AWS Amplify and EC2 and integrates Stripe payment, Google Firebase authentication, a Firebase NoSQL database and i18n language switching.

### ImageAid

A web application built in Next.js and Flask for assisting medical imaging diagnosis. It is deployed as a dockerized Flask server on Azure Container Apps. The API serves predictions and GradCAM visualizations from ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 PyTorch models fine-tuned on medical datasets representing brain tumors, Alzheimer’s
disease and pneumonia cases. Model development process uses Weights&Biases for experiment tracking and uploading the best model to Azure Blob Storage. The backend uses a factory method pattern for model object creation to keep the API intact while integrating new models for new diseases. Apache Airflow runs periodical checks of the image storage to detect data drifts.

### Serverless Suggestion

An MLOps system for a machine learning model which suggests medical services on a health platform. The train and predict methods are deployed as dockerized Python functions on AWS Lambda. The predict Lambda function loads the current model from an AWS S3 bucket, makes a prediction and saves the new input-output pair to the AWS RDS MySQL database. A SQL stored procedure triggers the train Lambda function if there is enough new data entries. Weights&Biases is used for monitoring the training process and selecting which model is uploaded to the AWS S3 bucket.
