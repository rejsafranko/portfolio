## Projects
### NBA Shot Predictor

Developed a model which classifies wheter a shot attempt was a score or a miss. Created an MLOps system for model deployment which consists of a Flask server, a PostgreSQL database and an Apache Airflow workflow orchestration for model retraining.

### Fish Cultivation Classifier

An academic effort which focuses on development of a fish cultivation classifier on a dataset owned by the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries of Croatia. I display the use of computer vision techniques, including data augmentation, a Vision Transformer (ViT), and a ResNet50 architecture for achieving accurate and robust classification results. Additionally, I've implemented a Grad-CAM visualizer for AI explainability, providing insights into the model's decision-making process.

### Song Lyric Generation with Deep Models

A research project which aims to create song lyric generators using various deep learning models. I've implemented four generators in total. Two for generic lyric generation and two for specific artist lyric generation. The models were trained on a song lyric datset created from 2 different data sources and evaluated through human assessments to ensure the generated lyrics are meaningful and stylistically accurate.

### Serverless Service Suggestion

Developed an in-house model which suggests service groups offered on a clinic managment web page. Created a fully automated MLOps system with Dockerized AWS Lambda Functions, AWS S3 and AWS Aurora RDS MySQL database.

## Achievements
- Finished 2nd place in LUMEN Data Science competition. The task was to create and deploy time-series models for predicting hotel room occupancy for a given reservation.
