## Academic Projects

### Fish Cultivation Classifier

An academic effort in computer vision engineering which focuses on development of a fish cultivation classifier. The dataset is owned by the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries of Croatia. I display the use of data augmentation, a Huggingface Vision Transformer (ViT), and a Tensorflow ResNet50 architecture for achieving accurate and robust classification results. Additionally, I've implemented a Grad-CAM visualizer for AI explainability, providing insights into the model's decision-making process.

### Song Lyric Generation with Deep Models

A natural language processing research project which aims to create song lyric generators using various deep learning models with PyTorch and Tensorflow. We have implemented four generators in total. Two for generic lyric generation and two for specific artist lyric generation. The models were trained on a song lyric datset created from 2 different data sources and evaluated through human assessments to ensure the generated lyrics are meaningful and stylistically accurate.

### Movie Recommendation Sytem

A machine learning engineering project which aims to create a movie recommendation model based on custom collaborative filtering. We've created an MLOps system for model deployment with a Flask server, Apache Airflow orchestration for model retraining, MLflow model management, PostgreSQL database and MinIO model storage.

## Personal Projects

### NBA Shot Predictor

A machine learning engineering project which aims to build a classification model for predicting wheter a shot attempt was a score or a miss. I have created an MLOps system for model deployment which consists of a Flask server, a PostgreSQL database and an Apache Airflow workflow orchestration for model retraining.
